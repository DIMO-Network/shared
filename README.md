# shared
Library code shared among our repositories

## vin utils
Use the VIN type for strings that are VIN's and it gets some basic decoding functionality (eg. year, or tesla model).

## config loader
Convention over configuration library for typed configurations that can read from yaml file or env vars. Provides an opinionated
way of dealing with configurations: for local development we want to use yaml config files, and on higher level environments 
we want settings to come from environment variables (we use kubernetes). Supported types are: string, int, int64, bool. 

## gRPC library

We should probably put these in the repositories of the services that own them, but we are putting this off for now. To make changes to the current suite for, e.g., the devices API, run

```
protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative api/devices/*.proto
```

## Linting

`brew install golangci-lint`

`golangci-lint run`

This should use the settings from `.golangci.yml`, which you can override.

If brew version does not work, download from https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/releases (darwin arm64 if M1), then copy to /usr/local/bin and sudo xattr -c golangci-lint
